    "# GitHub Copilot C# Demos\n\nThis repository contains a collection of C# demo projects designed for a developer session on GitHub Copilot. The objective is to showcase how AI can be integrated into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) using GitHub Copilot. Each demo includes code samples, a presentation script, and speaker notes to guide presenters.\n",
    
    "## üìÅ Repository Structure\n\n### 1. `Code Documentation`\n**Overview:** Demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can automatically generate XML documentation comments for C# methods and classes.\n- **Setup:** Open the solution in Visual Studio.\n- **Run:** Review the code and use Copilot to generate documentation.\n- **Presenter Guidance:** Follow the script to show before/after documentation and explain benefits.\n",
    
    "### 2. `Code Review`\n**Overview:** Simulates a pull request scenario where Copilot suggests improvements and identifies potential issues.\n- **Setup:** Open the solution and simulate a code change.\n- **Run:** Use Copilot to review and refactor code.\n- **Presenter Guidance:** Walk through Copilot suggestions and discuss code quality improvements.\n",
    
    "### 3. `Copilot Coding Agent`\n**Overview:** Uses natural language prompts to build a minimal ASP.NET Core web application.\n- **Setup:** Open the project in Visual Studio.\n- **Run:** Use prompts to generate controllers, views, and models.\n- **Presenter Guidance:** Demonstrate how Copilot builds the app step-by-step from prompts.\n",
    
    "### 4. `Contextual Intelligence`\n**Overview:** Highlights Copilot‚Äôs ability to understand and suggest code across multiple files.\n- **Setup:** Open the solution containing multiple classes and utility files.\n- **Run:** Modify a method and observe Copilot‚Äôs context-aware suggestions.\n- **Presenter Guidance:** Explain how Copilot maintains context across files.\n",
    
    "### 5. `Architectural Design Whiteboarding`\n**Overview:** Uses prompts to generate a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform.\n- **Setup:** Open the prompt file and use it in Copilot-enabled IDE.\n- **Run:** Review the generated architecture components and diagrams.\n- **Presenter Guidance:** Discuss how AI assists in platform design and architectural planning.\n",
